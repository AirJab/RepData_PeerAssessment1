###Loading libraries

```r
library(ggplot2, quietly = TRUE)
library(dplyr,quietly = TRUE)
library(lubridate,quietly = TRUE)
library(VIM,quietly = TRUE)
```

###Loading and preprocessing the data

```r
act <- data.table :: fread("./activity.csv")
```

###Converting date from chracter to Date class 

```r
act$date <- lubridate :: ymd(act$date)
```

##What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

###Total steps per day

```r
Total_steps <- aggregate(act$steps, FUN = sum, list(Day = act$date), na.rm=T)
```
###Plotting Hitogram for total daily steps

```r
ggplot(Total_steps,aes(x)) + 
        geom_histogram(binwidth=2000 ,fill="red",
        colour="black", size=1) + labs(title="Histogram of Total Daily Steps",
        x="Total Daily Steps", y="Frequency")
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-27](figure/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png)

###Calculating and reporting the mean and median of TotalDaily Steps

```r
mean_1 <- mean(Total_steps$x)
median_1 <- median(Total_steps$x)
```
###Mean

```r
mean_1
```

```
## [1] 9354.23
```
###Median

```r
median_1
```

```
## [1] 10395
```
##What is the average daily activity pattern?

###Constructing a dataframe for Average Daily Activity Pattern

```r
Avg_steps <- aggregate(act$steps,
        FUN = mean, list(Interval = act$interval), na.rm=T)
```

###Line plot for Average Daily Activity Pattern

```r
ggplot(Avg_steps, aes(Interval, x)) + geom_line(colour="blue",size=1) +
    labs(title = "Average Daily Activity Pattern", y="Average number of steps")
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-32](figure/unnamed-chunk-32-1.png)

###The 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, that contains the maximum number of steps

```r
Avg_steps$Interval[Avg_steps$x==max(Avg_steps$x)]
```

```
## [1] 835
```

##Imputing missing values

###Number of "NA" present

```r
length(act$steps[act$steps == "NA"])
```

```
## [1] 2304
```
###Creating a new dataframe by imputing missing values by K-Nearest Neighbour method

```r
act_imputed <- kNN(act, variable="steps", k=5)
```

###Total steps per day (imputed)

```r
Total_steps_imputed <- aggregate(act_imputed$steps, FUN = sum, list(Day = act_imputed$date), na.rm=T)
```

###Plotting Hitogram for total daily steps (imputed)

```r
ggplot(Total_steps_imputed,aes(x)) + 
    geom_histogram(binwidth=2000 ,fill="red",
    colour="black", size=1) + labs(title="Histogram of Total Daily Steps (with imputed              data)",x="Total Daily Steps", y="Frequency")
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-37](figure/unnamed-chunk-37-1.png)

###Calculating and reporting the mean and median of Total Daily Steps (Imputed)

```r
mean_2 <- mean(Total_steps_imputed$x)
median_2 <- median(Total_steps_imputed$x)
```
####Mean (imputed):

```r
mean_2
```

```
## [1] 9752.393
```
####Median (imputed):

```r
median_2
```

```
## [1] 10395
```
###Difference in mean, mean(imputed) - mean(original)


```r
mean_2 - mean_1
```

```
## [1] 398.1639
```
###Difference in median, median(imputed) - median(original)
median_2-median_1


###There is was no change in the mdian after imputation, but the mean increased by 398.1639

##Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

###Creating factor variables with two levels - weekday and weekend

```r
act_imputed$Day_Factor <- ifelse(weekdays(act$date) %in% 
                c("Sunday","Saturday"), "weekend","weekday")
```
###Constructing a dataframe for Average Daily Activity Pattern for weekdays and weekends

```r
Avg_steps_imputed_days <- aggregate(act_imputed$steps,
                            FUN = mean, list(Interval = act_imputed$interval,
                            Day=act_imputed$Day_Factor),  na.rm=T)
```
###Line plot for Average Daily Activity Pattern (with imputed steps) with breakdown in weekday and weekend 

```r
ggplot(Avg_steps_imputed_days, aes(Interval, x,colour=factor(Day))) + geom_line(size=1) +
    facet_wrap(~Day, ncol = 1, nrow=2)+
    labs(title = "Average Daily Activity Pattern (with imputed data)", 
    y="Average number of steps", color="Day")
```
